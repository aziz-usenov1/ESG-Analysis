# ESG-Analysis

## Variables

**DV 1: Environmental attitudes**
- How worried are you about climate change? (1-5 scale, variable name: '**wrclmch**')
- How much have you thought about climate change before today? (1-5 scale, variable name: '**clmthgt2**')
- How good or bad do you think the impact of climate change will be on people across the world? Please choose a number from 0 to 10, where 0 is extremely bad and 10 is extremely good? (0-10 scale, reverse-coded by the authors to range from 0 (good) to 10 (bad), variable name: '**ccgdbd_reversed**')

**DV 2: Environmental behaviours**
- If you were to buy a large electrical appliance for your home, how likely is it that you would buy one of the most energy efficient ones? (0-10 scale, variable name: '**eneffap**')
- There are some things that can be done to reduce energy use, such as switching off appliances that are not being used, walking for short journeys, or only using the heating or air conditioning when really needed. In your daily life, how often do you do things to reduce your energy use? (1-6 scale, variable name: '**rdcenr**')
- To what extent do you feel a personal responsibility to try to reduce climate change? (0-10 scale, variable name: '**ccrdprs**')

**World Bank Data about Educational Attainment**
- Educational attainment, at least completed lower secondary, population 25+, total (%) (cumulative)
## Hypotheses


**Sub-question 1:** How do urban and rural residents differ in their pro-environmental attitudes?
- H1.0: There is no difference in the environmental attitudes of urban and rural residents.
- H1.A: There is a difference in the environmental attitudes of urban and rural residents.

**Sub-question 2:** How do urban and rural residents differ in their pro-environmental behaviors?
- H2.0: There is no difference in the environmental behaviour of urban and rural residents.
- H2.A: There is a difference in the environmental behaviour of urban and rural residents.

_Additionally,_ the difference in environmental attitudes and behaviours between rural and urban residents may differ between countries, for instance because of different cultures, political debates, or infrastructure. Thus, to identify if there are European countries where the gap is greater or smaller in regards to our main relationship of interest, we ask a third sub-question.

**Sub-question 3:** What are country-level differences in environmental attitudes and behaviours?
- H3.0: There is no difference in the gap of environmental attitudes/behaviours of urban and rural residents between countries.
- H3.A: There is a difference in the gap of environmental attitudes/behaviours of urban and rural residents between countries.

_Further_ diving into context effects, countries with lower educational attainment may have larger urban-rural disparities in environmental education. This would also lead to a greater division in environmental attitudes and behaviours, between cities and the countryside, as some authors postulate that environmental education is the main factor mediating this relationship (Yu 2014). Thus, we ask a fourth sub-question.

**Sub-question 4:** Does the overall level of educational attainment in a country influence the urban-rural differences between environmental attitudes and behaviors?
- H4.0: There is no difference in the gap of environmental attitudes/behaviours of urban and rural residents between countries with high or low educational attainment.
- H4.A: There is a difference in the gap of environmental attitudes/behaviours of urban and rural residents between countries with high or low educational attainment.

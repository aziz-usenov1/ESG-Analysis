## Hypotheses

**Sub-question 1:** How do urban and rural residents differ in their pro-environmental attitudes?
- H1.0: There is no difference in the environmental attitudes of urban and rural residents.
- H1.A: There is a difference in the environmental attitudes of urban and rural residents.

**Sub-question 2:** How do urban and rural residents differ in their pro-environmental behaviors?
- H2.0: There is no difference in the environmental behaviour of urban and rural residents.
- H2.A: There is a difference in the environmental behaviour of urban and rural residents.

_Additionally,_ the difference in environmental attitudes and behaviours between rural and urban residents may differ between countries, for instance because of different cultures, political debates, or infrastructure. Thus, to identify if there are European countries where the gap is greater or smaller in regards to our main relationship of interest, we ask a third sub-question.

**Sub-question 3:** What are country-level differences in environmental attitudes and behaviours?
- H3.0: There is no difference in the gap of environmental attitudes/behaviours of urban and rural residents between countries.
- H3.A: There is a difference in the gap of environmental attitudes/behaviours of urban and rural residents between countries.

_Further_ diving into context effects, countries with lower educational attainment may have larger urban-rural disparities in environmental education. This would also lead to a greater division in environmental attitudes and behaviours, between cities and the countryside, as some authors postulate that environmental education is the main factor mediating this relationship (Yu 2014). Thus, we ask a fourth sub-question.

**Sub-question 4:** Does the overall level of educational attainment in a country influence the urban-rural differences between environmental attitudes and behaviors?
- H4.0: There is no difference in the gap of environmental attitudes/behaviours of urban and rural residents between countries with high or low educational attainment.
- H4.A: There is a difference in the gap of environmental attitudes/behaviours of urban and rural residents between countries with high or low educational attainment.
